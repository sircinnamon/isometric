# isometric
This tool takes a top down grid and converts into into (something resembling) an isometric version of that map

Isometric maps turn 90 degree angles into 120 degree angles in an attempt to simulate a 3d perspective. This script rotates the given image 45 degrees, then widens it to 173.2% which accomplishes this.
